Matlab scripts for the Okada solution
======

This script computates the static co-seismic displacements due to a dislocation-type deformation in a half-space

Description: This exact solution is often used to construct co-seismic displacements due to an underwater earthquake. These displacements are then used to construct in some way an initial condition for tsunami propagation codes.

For more details, please, have a look at the original Okada paper:

More sophisticated approaches to the tsunami generation problem can be found in other [publications](http://www.denys-dutykh.com/publications.php/) of the [author](www.denys-dutykh.com/).
